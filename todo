leaderf switching working directory mode
    g:Lf_WorkingDirectoryMode                      
        e.g., >
        let g:Lf_WorkingDirectoryMode = 'Ac'

        c - the directory of the current working directory.(default)
        a - the nearest ancestor of current working directory that contains one of
            directories or files defined in |g:Lf_RootMarkers|. Fall back to 'c' if
            no such ancestor directory found.
        A - the nearest ancestor of current file that contains one of directories
            or files defined in |g:Lf_RootMarkers|. Fall back to 'c' if no such
            ancestor directory found.
        f - the directory of the current file.
        F - if the current working directory is not the direct ancestor of current
            file, use the directory of the current file as LeaderF's working
            directory, otherwise, same as 'c'.
        Note: if "f", "F" is included with "a" or "A", use the behavior of "f" or
        "F"(as a fallback) when a root can't be found.
